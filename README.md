# Voldemort Project üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Welcome to the **Voldemort** project! This repository showcases our journey in developing a chess game using Java. Below are the details of what we've accomplished so far:

## Features ‚ú®

- **Piece Movement**: Players can move pieces on the board using commands like `e2 e4`.
- **Input Validation**: The game checks for valid input formats and whether a piece exists at the source position.
- **Game Status Display**: The current state of the game is displayed after each move, helping players keep track.

## Future Enhancements üöÄ

- Implementing chess rules for each piece.
- Adding game status notifications (check, checkmate).
- Developing a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Introducing AI for single-player mode.
- Saving and loading game states.

## How to Run the Project üñ•Ô∏è

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://git.txstate.edu/qmh16/Voldemort.git
